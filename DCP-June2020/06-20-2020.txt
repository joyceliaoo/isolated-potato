Problem:
The area of a circle is defined as πr^2. Estimate π to 3 decimal places using a Monte Carlo method.

Hint: The basic equation of a circle is x^2 + y^2 = r^2.


Solution:
Let D = a square with side length of 1 unit centered at the origin on the 2-D plane

Let C = circle inscribed in D

Area(D) = 1 unit^2
Area(C) = pi/4

Randomly generate (x,y) points and count the number of points in C or in D

If we generate enough points, then Area(C)/Area(D) == # pts inside the circle / # pts inside square

So pi == 4 * # pts inside the circle / # pts inside square
